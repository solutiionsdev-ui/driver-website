/**
 * The helmet's cursor rotation, one axis at a time: the angle it reaches when
 * the cursor is at the **edge of the window** (`ampDeg`, signed — the sign is
 * the direction), and how it gets there (`curve`).
 *
 * The amplitude is the whole instrument. Until 2026-09-08 each axis was a gain
 * on the pointer, and the pitch had a cap on its *input* on top (`helmetRotX`
 * × `tiltLimit`); the angle a reader actually saw was the product of the two,
 * in radians of input, and the yaw had no ceiling at all. Nobody could say
 * how far the helmet turned without doing the sum, and once the gain sat at
 * its slider's floor there was no way to ask for more. Now the slider *is*
 * the answer: the degrees at the edge of the sweep, per axis.
 *
 * `curve` is the shape between the centre and that edge, and it is
 * **normalised** — `tanh(curve·v) / tanh(curve)` — so it reaches exactly the
 * amplitude at `|v| = 1` whatever its value: 0 is a straight line, higher
 * saturates earlier, which keeps the response steep through the middle of the
 * frame (where a reader's pointer actually lives) and eases it off toward the
 * edges. `tanh` rather than a clamp because a clamp leaves a corner where the
 * turn stops dead, and that corner sits exactly where a cursor crossing the
 * frame is moving fastest — the helmet would visibly freeze mid-sweep and then
 * start again. This has no such point: the response only ever thins.
 *
 * Sizing the pitch needs the crown's **on-screen** travel, which is not the
 * obvious number. Tilting about a horizontal axis moves the crown almost
 * entirely in **z**: `y' = h·cos(theta)` changes only in theta squared, while
 * `z' = h·sin(theta)` is first-order. So `h·sin(theta)` — the tempting figure —
 * is the crown's *depth* swing, and what a reader sees is the much smaller
 * second-order drop plus what perspective makes of the depth. Measured
 * properly (project the crown through the real camera), visible travel across
 * a full cursor sweep at 1440x900 comes to about **2.4px per degree** of
 * amplitude, near enough linear over the range the slider offers: 4.4° is
 * 10.7px, 7.2° is 17.5px, 8.6° is 20.9px. For scale, `subjectParallax` moves
