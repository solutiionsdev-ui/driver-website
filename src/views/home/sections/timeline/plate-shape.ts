/**
 * The timeline plate, as geometry.
 *
 * The design ships this as an exported SVG — a rounded rectangle with a step
 * cut out of its bottom-right edge — and it ships it twice, once per size. The
 * two exports are the same curve at 2.13x, so it survives here as **one** path
 * rather than two assets. It has to be a path rather than an `<img>` anyway:
 * these plates are content frames, and an image of a rectangle cannot hold
 * anything.
 *
 * `PLATE_VIEW` is the larger export's own box, so `PLATE_OUTLINE` is drawn at
 * the coordinates the designer set. `PLATE_CLIP` is the same curve normalised
 * to a unit box, for a `clipPathUnits="objectBoundingBox"` clip that scales
 * with whatever it is put on. The two plate sizes differ in aspect by 0.2%,
 * which is why one normalised curve serves both.
