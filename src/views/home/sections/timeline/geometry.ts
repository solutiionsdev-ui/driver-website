 * pixels across a crossing — that difference, not any single figure, is the
 * effect. Order is a depth order: the copy sits over the photograph on `z-20`
 * and is the nearest thing to the reader, so it moves most; the centre plate
 * is the ground the row is built on and barely moves at all. The year is a
 * plate's marker rather than a layer of its own, so it takes whichever figure
 * its plate does and stays registered on it.

 * - A **centre** plate drifting into the side row above it clears that row's
 *   plate — those sit out at the gutters and never overlap a centre plate
 *   horizontally — but the side row's *year* is at its centre, ~109px away.
 * - A **side** plate drifting into the centre row above it clears that plate
 *   for the same reason, and reaches its copy at ~181px: the copy starts at
 *   1020 and a right-aligned side plate at 1075, so those two do overlap.
 * - The **copy** only ever moves inside its own 462-tall row: it sits at the
 *   row's middle, 231px from either edge, and copy is only ever set on centre
 *   rows.
 *
 * Every figure below is inside half of its own limit.

 * own width like everything else here, so the copy's 110 design pixels are
