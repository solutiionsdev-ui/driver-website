 * How far the figure is displaced when the footer first appears, in design

 *
 * The footer is the last block, so it never finishes a crossing: its bottom
 * cannot leave the top of the viewport. A travel hung off the usual
 * `top bottom` → `bottom top` window would therefore stop part-way and leave
 * the figure permanently displaced in the state everyone ends the page on. The
 * window here closes at `bottom bottom` instead — the moment the page is
 * scrolled to its end — and the figure's `to` is its design position, so where
 * a reader comes to rest is exactly the frame.
 *
 * The displacement is **downward** for the same reason the pair is not clipped
 * to the panel: the suit hangs 8 past the foot to cover the accent edge, and
 * lifting the figure by more than that would show the cyan strip along the
 * bottom that the design does not have. Down is free — the section clips it.
 *
 * The helmet and the suit move as **one group**, not as two layers. They are a
 * single figure resting on its own collar; separating them by even a few
 * pixels takes the head off the shoulders, which is the same failure noted on
 * `FIGURE` above for scaling them apart.
