 * page's gutters with the hero, and that is exactly what made its type the
 * odd one out: below 1280 the root font size is pinned at 16, so a 55 here
 * stayed 55 while the same 55 in the timeline scaled with the viewport. At
 * 768 the two headlines came out 55 and 29.3 side by side. On `cqw` all four
 * blocks scale as one, and at 1440 nothing moves — a rem *is* a design pixel
